<p><hr1><b>Emma's Happy Points Journey"</b>
<hr/></hr1></p>
<body><p>Subtitle: "Fun Deeds, Big Smiles"</p>

    <p>Meet Emma, a cheerful second-grader at Sunshine Elementary. In her class, they had a cool system called<q>"Happy Points"</q>  for doing good things.
 Emma, along with her best friend Jake, decided to collect as many points as they could.</p>
  
  
 <p>From sharing crayons with Timmy to saying kind words to Mrs. Johnson, Emma's face lit up each time she earned a Happy Point. 
The points were like little stars on her chart, shining brighter with every good deed.</p>

    <P><i>One day, their teacher, Mrs. Turner, shared exciting news: the kid with the most Happy Points would get a special surprise. 
        Emma was determined! She helped clean up after art class, shared her snack with someone, and even made a colorful drawing for the classroom wall.</i></P>

<p>The day of the surprise arrived, and Emma's heart raced. Mrs. Turner announced her as the winner! Emma beamed with joy as she received a shiny new storybook.
     But the best part? The warm feeling inside her heart, knowing that little acts of kindness could make everyone happy.
      And so, Emma's Happy Points journey became a tale of smiles and friendship.</p>

<p><hr5>Moral</hr5><q>"Emma's Happy Points Journey"</q>teaches us that the true joy in life comes not just from winning prizes or rewards
     but from the happiness we bring to others through small acts of kindness. 
     The story encourages kids to find joy in spreading positivity, helping friends, and making the world around them a happier place.
      It highlights the idea that the real treasure lies in the warmth of a kind heart and the smiles shared with friends.</p>

        but in the journey of spreading kindness and bringing smiles to others."</ins> </blockquote>
